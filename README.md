## Components
### Component 1: Data Ingestion
Reading data from any storage such as a database, cloud storage like blob storage, or anything.

### Component 2: Data Transformation
To encode the data using encoding techniques such as label encoding and one-hot encoding.
All the transformation of data will be implemented under this component.

### Component 3: Model Training
Model training will be implemented under this component.
To train the model, execute the following command in the terminal:
